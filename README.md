# Music-Gerenaration-Algorithms
a selection of music algorithms from various programs previously written, expect varying degrees of success and quality.

all files are in c++ 11 other than several js versions of serialism functions , igonore any qt references, should work fine without qt installed, i have outlined the kinds of musical functions written below:

- mode based (ie ionian, dorian, locrian etc..) haromic generation system - see psa express
- pop, jazz and classical harmony and structure systems
- serialism algorithms, in c++11 and js (basically code that creates 12 tone rows then manipulates them using serialist theory :))


feedback very much apprecieated, all work is strictly amateur and largely poorly written but the basic process work and produce surpirisingly interesting results

all published files may be used by anyone but please ASK permission first !
